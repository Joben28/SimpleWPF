# Contributing

- When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. 
- Small changes, optimizations, or the like do not require a discussion before hand. Just send a pull request and everything can be hashed out there
- Take the time to observe the conventions of the code-base and try to follow them in your contributions.
- Make commits in a relevant manner. With clear titles, comments that pertain to a single issue or implementation.
- If you are new to contributing and make mistakes that is fine! I am new to it as well -- I'll make some of my own.
